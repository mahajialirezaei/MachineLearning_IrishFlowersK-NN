# MachineLearning_IrishFlowersK-NN
In this exercise, we will use an algorithm called “k Nearest Neighbor” or k-NN, which is a common machine learning algorithm. By doing this exercise, we will explore topics such as vector calculations using arrays, using aggregate and general functions, and indexing using arrays.
