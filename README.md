# Iris Flowers Dataset Analysis

This project is a Jupyter Notebook that analyzes the famous **Iris Flowers Dataset**. The notebook includes data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning models to classify different species of iris flowers.

## Features
- **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset and displaying sample records.
- **Data Visualization**: Using plots to explore feature distributions.
- **Machine Learning**: Training a classification model to predict iris species.
- **Conclusion**: Insights and findings from the analysis.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
```

## Usage
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.
2. Run the cells sequentially to execute the analysis.
3. Modify the parameters to explore different results.

## Dataset
The dataset contains 150 samples of iris flowers, categorized into three species: **Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica**. Each sample has four features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
